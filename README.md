## About me

I'm a second year Computer Science student at Birmingham City University, as well as a software engineer at my University's Software House!

I do my main work using Python, sometimes JavaScript as well, though, in my spare time, I really enjoy playing around in C++ and exploring different deep learning applications, as deep learning is one of the fields I am most interested in.

For example, I am currently working on a [GAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.2661.pdf) that generates progressive metal music breakdowns. Since one of my passions, aside from programming, involves progressive metal music, I thought it would be nice to combine them and create a passion-driven project. I plan on expanding this project for my final year dissertation, but until then, I'm just researching and experimenting with stuff. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/j4ndrw/djenerator-GAN).

## What I'm currently learning

At the moment, I'm expanding my knowledge on deep learning from a low-level standpoint. Right now I'm looking more into vector calculus and in-depth details on how different gradient descent algorithms works, mathematically-speaking. Aside from that, I sometimes like to solve data structures and algorithms problems in C++. I've done this from the beginning, in highschool, and will continue on using C++ since I love it! :D

## How you can reach me

I don't use social media that much, though if you wish to contact me you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrei-alin-murjan-812908197/).
